# Aloha Apparel Co. Website

Built by **Matthew Wong** | _matthew.aramis@gmail.com_

This website was built over the course of two weeks. It is meant to be a re-creation of a demo website given to my class for our first project.

## "Technologies" Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- "Flickity" (Used for the Featured Items carousel)

## Lessons Learned

- The browser console is a very powerful tool, and your best friend when it comes to debugging
- Flexbox, while powerful, can sometimes cause other formatting to become unpredictable
- Be careful when using `max-width` and `min-width`, as they can also cause certain formatting paramaters to become unpredictable
- It's okay to push commits often
- **Don't** leave the README file until 30 minutes before the due date

**Thanks for viewing my README!**
